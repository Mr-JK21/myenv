This policy sets out how we handle your personal information if you’re an Gharwakhri user or visitor to our Sites.</li>
                                            <li>When we say ‘We’, ‘Us’ or ‘Gharwakhri’ it’s because that’s who we are and we own and run the Sites.</li>
                                            <li>If we say ‘policy’ we’re talking about this privacy policy. If we say ‘user terms’ we’re talking about the rules for using our Site.

                                        <h4>The type of personal information we collect</h4>
                                        <ol start="4">
                                            <li>We collect certain personal information about visitors and users of our Sites.</li>
                                            <li>The most common types of information we collect include things like: user-names, email addresses,other contact details, photos, support queries, comments (if applicable), content you direct us to make available on our Sites (such as item descriptions), your actions on our Sites (including any selections or inputs into items) and web and email analytics data.</li>
                                        </ol>
                                        <h4>How we collect personal information</h4>
                                        <ol start="6">
                                            <li>We collect personal information directly when you provide it to us, automatically as you navigate through the Sites, or through other people when you use services associated with the Sites.</li>
                                            <li>We collect your personal information when you provide it to us when you complete membership registration and order or provide items on our Sites, subscribe to a newsletter, email list, submit feedback, or send us a communication.</li>
                                            <li>
                                                As the operator of digital content marketplaces, we have a legitimate interest in verifying the identity of our authors. We believe that knowing who our authors are will strengthen the integrity of our marketplaces by reducing fraud, making authors more accountable for their content and giving Gharwakhri and customers the ability to enforce contracts for authors who break the rules. Gharwakhri also has certain legal obligations that require us to know who our authors are in certain circumstances. In light of this, if you are an author we will verify your identity, in particular, your name, full address and date of birth by asking you to show us a Photo ID document. The verification procedure is called Gharwakhri Verify. We will use your Photo ID document solely to carry out Gharwakhri Verify and delete it after the completion of this process.
                                            </li>
                                        </ol>

The information varies and is controlled by that service provider or as authorized by you via your privacy settings at that service provider; and</li>
                                                    <li>

We also receive information about you as a rights holder from our third party authors. For example, information in the form of a model release when your image is used in an item made available
                                                        on our Sites.
